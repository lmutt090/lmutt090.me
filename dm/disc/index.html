        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <h2>Use Server Rules</h2>
                <p>If you are messaging me from a server, those rules apply here as long as these rules and notes don't contradict. Otherwise, these take priority.</p>
            <h2>No NSFW</h2>
                <p>I don't care if it's one of my characters, this is a direct message channel, not an NSFW channel.</p>
            <h2>No E-dating</h2>
                <p>I am a minor. Please don't bug me about dating. You <strong>will</strong> be blocked if I don't know you.</p>
            <h2>Common Sense</h2>
                <p>Basically, if you're talking to someone, use common sense. If so,</p>
                <p>Congrats.</p>
                <p>If not, use it... and not just for me.</p>
                <p>I am not explaining this.</p>
            <h2>Disagreements</h2>
                <p>If you disagree with me, fine! No harm, no foul!</p>
                <p>But if you disagree with me and <strong>fight</strong> me about it, then you're being a problem.</p>
                <p>It's fine if you try to change my mind, just know when to stop.</p>
        <h1>Notes</h1>
            <h2>Probable Problems</h2>
                <p>I don't respond very fast.</p>
                <p>I am an admin in a Discord server.</p>
                <p>I have a job at Wendy's, that's how I have Nitro, so I won't always be available.</p>
            <h2>Server</h2>
                <p>I host a Terraria server. It's extremely small and I am not looking for any partnerships.</p>
            <h2>Dumb info that I somehow need to say</h2>
                <p>Yeah, I'm a furry, so what?</p>
                <p>Do not say how you dislike this page. DEAL WITH IT.</p>
