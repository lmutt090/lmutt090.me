        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <h2>Use Server Rules</h2>
            <p>If you are messaging me from a server, those rules apply here as long as these rules and notes dont contradict, otherwise, these take priority</p>
        <h2>No NSFW</h2>
            <p>I dont care if it's one of my characters, this is a Direct Message channel, not an NSFW cahnnel</p>
        <h2>Common Sense</h2>
            <p>Basically, if you're talking to someone, you use this. If so,</p>
            <p>Congrats</p>
            <p>If not, use it... and not just for me</p>
            <p>I am not explaining this</p>
        <h2>Disagreements</h2>
            <p>If you disagree with me, fine! It's no harm no foul!</p>
            <p>But if you disagree with me and <b>fight</b> me about it, then you're being a problem</p>
            <p>It's fine if you try to change my mind, just know when to stop</p>
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>Probable Problems</h2>

        <p>I am an admin in a Discord Server</p>
        <p>I have a job, that's how I have nitro dumbass</p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>I host a Terraria server, it's extremely small and I am not looking for any partnerships</p>
        <h2>Dumb info that I somehow NEED to say</h2>
